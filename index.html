        <p>Germany's history dates back to the Holy Roman Empire, which began in the 9th century. Over the centuries, Germany evolved from a collection of small kingdoms and principalities into a unified nation-state in 1871 under Prussian leadership. The 20th century saw the country torn apart by two World Wars. After World War II, Germany was divided into East and West, each aligned with different superpowers. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 led to reunification, and today, Germany is a leading force in the European Union.</p>
        <p>Significant moments include the Reformation initiated by Martin Luther in the 16th century, the creation of the Weimar Republic after World War I, and the impact of the Nazi regime during World War II. Germany’s modern history is one of recovery, innovation, and leadership in global affairs.</p>
